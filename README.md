# UnionFind_test_poject

The project demonstrates the use of the Union-Find algorithm to check the presence in the maze described by the two-dimensional square matrix consisting of 0 and 1,
a path between the upper left and lower right angles.
The input matrix is in fact a maze where 1 means that the route is available while 0 means that it is not. Diagonal route paths are not allowed, only horizontal and vertical.
